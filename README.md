# Galaga2.0

This is a summer project that I completed in ten days. 
I created a game that is similar to the popular arcade game, Galaga, but different in a few ways.

Galaga is an extremely complicated game, so many features were unimplemented in Galaga2.0.
That said, my intention was not to create a replica and I chose a few unique features such as
multi player mode, sinusoidal movement, shotgun bullets, and multi threading.

My inspiration for this project was my dad, who used to play Galaga so often in his childhood 
that his high score was over 2 million points!

The game is written in C++ and uses SFML for graphics and bazel for building.

Credit to NAMCO for the sprites' textures (e.g. rocket ship, bugs).
